* The rationale

All builders of permanent DIY power wall batteries using refurbished 18650 cells need a way to mount the power packs into a rack or onto a wall where the battery will be
deployed. For battery packs using the commonly found [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003181626763.html][4x5 or other format cell spacers/holders]] people have been using any number of ad-hoc solutions amounting to putting cell
"blocks" on some kind of shelf or support and letting gravity do its work (for example [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyVK59ozYDE][here]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh5Bff3Ae8E][here]]). I have initially considered the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTU-w8iya0c][HBPowerwall 18650 mount]] to mount my cells
but further research has pointed me towards a better solution - using TH-35 (aka DIN rails) and mount the cell packs on them. There are numerous advantages to using DIN rails:

- they are a standard industry component which can be easily purchased instead of ordering custom-cut sheet metal like you would for the HBPowerwall mount
- they are very versatile with mounting equipment other than the packs themselves with a lot of typical electrical equipment mountable on a DIN rail
- they are easily expandable for multiple sizes or amounts of 18650 cell blocks, the HBPowerwall mount is designed for a 4x20 cell block and needs extra tricks to fit bigger
  blocks (like shown on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EltBFVKStEg][this example]] with 10x20 blocks)

the main disadvantage of using DIN rails to mount cell blocks is that the alignment of rails needs to be precise if two rails need to support a single cell block. This will be
the case for most deployments and might require some kind of base board instead of using the wall directly. Naturally, using a bent sheet metal holder which already has the
proper dimensions takes care of the above for us.

While looking for existing designs for mounting 18650 cell blocks on DIN rails a number of existing solutions have been documented.

After studying these solutions I have found a number of drawbacks with all of them:

- they are designed to hold relatively small cell blocks not near enough to having for example 4x20 block capacity
- many of them use a lot of filament in order to clip the cell holders from two sides and allow the block to "clip into" the holders
- some of them use the triangle-shaped cutouts in the holders which don't allow for the [[https://batteryhookup.com/collections/accessories/products/nickel-fuse-2p-wide-continuous-roll-by-the-foot-18650-cell-level-fusing?variant=34549080457378][Batteryhookup nickel fuse roll]] to be used on the blocks

The above findings have prompted me to design my own system of DIN rail mounts for 18650 cell blocks with the following features in mind:

- flexibility - the mounts should allow for either small or large blocks that might need to be supported by more than one parallel DIN rail
- price - the amount of filament used should be as small as possible
- unobstructed both positive and negative sides of the cell pack in order to facilitate all ways of connecting the cells to busbars

** Mount design

The mounting bracket design has been performed in [[https://www.freecadweb.org/][FreeCAD]] and can be downloaded here. The basic design can be seen below:

This part has variants for both male and female dovetails as well as only hook, only clip or both hook+clip variants:
