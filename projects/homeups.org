* Overview

A UPS which can power my entire home is built using a Schrack [[http://image.schrack.com/datenblaetter/h_usdd_en.pdf][GENIO Online USDD400]] UPS connected to four customized stock battery boxes. The battery boxes are retired [[https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Symmetra-LX-Battery-Module/P-SYBT5][APC SYBT5]] which
originally are 120 Vdc nominal and contain 10 x 12V 9Ah sealed lead-acid batteries. The total energy capacity of one unit is a little over 1kWh.

** Battery boxes

A single SYBT5 battery box can be seen below:

After lifting the cover the internals are revealed:

Apart from the batteries themselves the unit contains:

- a safety DC switch used to disconnect the battery string and allow for safe work on the pack
- a backplane connector
- a controller board with a DC fuse

In order for the battery box to work with my UPS I needed to remove a single battery from the string leaving 9 x 12V 9Ah and a 108 Vdc nominal voltage. The rewiring process was a breeze thanks to the 
well engineered internal layout and excellent quality of the internal cables and connectors. Kudos APC!

** Safety switch

A single feature worth mentioning for the safety switch is that it contains two pairs of contacts - high current where the batteries are connected and control contacts. The control contacts are connected 
to the controller board to sense the state of the switch. I have left them connected there for now.

** Backplane connector

After some digging around I highly suspect that the backplane connector is an Anderson Power Products [[https://www.andersonpower.com/content/dam/app/ecommerce/product-pdfs/DS-PP1545.pdf][Powerpole PP15-45 Finger Proof]] hermaphroditic connector. The jagged edge on the connector means
it's a Finger Proof variant. I wanted to buy some of these connectors and make myself a proper plug however I couldn't find any reasonable priced offers in my country. So I got rid of the connectors
and just connected my own cables.

** Controller board

The controller board contains a beefy fuse (no wonder, the battery unit is rated for UPSes up to 14 kVA), a current sense shunt and a PIC microcontroller.

I had no use for the controller board so I just left it as it is in the case as it allowed me to just use the original DC fuse.

** Wiring box

I decided to wire up all 4 battery boxes in parallel and connect them to the original UPS battery input. The image below shows the junction box I used with just the screw terminals so that you can 
see better. I took care to carefully color-code all of the terminals and cables as a mistake at this point when all of the batteries are charged would have drastic consequences.

The 4 boards on the left are 4 current sense boards using the [[https://www.allegromicro.com/en/Products/Sense/Current-Sensor-ICs/Fifty-To-Two-Hundred-Amp-Integrated-Conductor-Sensor-ICs/ACS758][ACS758]] Hall-effect sensor IC to monitor the current going in and out for all battery packs. 

* Inverter

The inverter is a 4 kVA single-phase inverter made by Schrack. Unfortunately, I was only able to find a manual for it in [[https://image.schrackcdn.com/bedienungsanleitungen/a_usdd400xxx_pl.pdf][Polish]]. The manual contains
(apart from the usual stuff) a pinout for the RS-232 connector with I/O controlling UPS shutdown or indicating running on battery power.
The UPS can be controlled by a piece of software called PowerShield but I was not yet able to find or download it. The UPS has a manual bypass switch
which allows for on-line battery replacement, this is described [[https://image.schrackcdn.com/bedienungsanleitungen/a_usddbe_en.pdf][here]].

* AC side

As my entire house is wired with 3-phase AC grid power I needed a way to supply all 3 phases using a single-phase inverter. Fortunately, as I do not power any equipment which actually requires proper
3-phase power I can get away with simply feeding all phases from one source - the inverter. This is achieved using a custom-made C19 to standard 3-phase 16A plug cable. 

[[file:inverter-3phase-connection.jpg][file:thumb-inverter-3phase-connection.jpg]]

The wires are colored according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60446][IEC 60446]] with blue being the neutral, green/yellow the PE and blue is neutral.

I have also added a [[http://lechacal.com/modwrt/pzem-016_pzem014_user_manual.pdf][PZEM-016]] power meter to the mix to monitor how much kW my inverter is producing and feeding back into the house.
