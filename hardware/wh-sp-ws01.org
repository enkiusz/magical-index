This is an anemometer for a very popular weather station sold on aliexpress (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001089508787.html)

The box is labeled that the anemometer is a wind speed sensor for WH2081 which is I assume the weather station model.

It has an RJ-11 connector with a short cable:

The way in which pulses from the anemometer can be converted into wind speed has been documented in one of the aliexpress offers https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000352147677.html

Quote:

Wind speed is passive switch quantity, wind speed sensor, turn 1 turns, 2 pulse =2HZ.
Formula for wind speed: m/s=wind speed Hz * 0.34

Rainfall is passive switch, rain bucket reverses once = 0.33mm

Wind direction: resistance network, equivalent to stepping potentiometer, the user connected to a 10K pull-up resistance voltage, SCM AD can detect the voltage.
The wind direction is marked with NSWE direction. 

There is also a connection schematic on the same site:
