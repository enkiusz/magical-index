* Hardware 

The GOPHERT CPS-3205 II power supply is a very cheap lab power supply that can be purchased for example on [[https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&SearchText=GOPHERT+CPS+3205][aliexpress]]. It has two boards inside:

- a main power board
- a smaller controller board screwed in front

Both boards are connected using a short bundle of wires with pins labeled on both ends. The wire is marked as SW19 on the controller board.

Main chips on the controller board are:

The current settings on the power supply maps to the voltage on the C.C pin in the following way:

| Setting [A] | C.C voltage [V] |
|-------------+-----------------|
|     0 (MIN) |           0.022 |
|         0.5 |           0.640 |
|           1 |           0.914 |
|         1.5 |           1.188 |
|           2 |           1.462 |
|         2.5 |           1.737 |
|           3 |            2.00 |
|         3.5 |            2.27 |
|           4 |            2.55 |
|         4.5 |            2.82 |
|           5 |            3.10 |
|   5.1 (MAX) |            3.15 |

After running a simple linear regression using [[http://www.xuru.org/rt/LR.asp#CopyPaste]] on this data we find out that the relationship between the display and 
driving voltage is:

C.C voltage [V] = 0.573 * Current [A] + 0.264

Corresponding table mapping the voltage seen on the C.S pin and the current displayed is provided below:

| C.S voltage [V] | Current display [A] |

|           1.055 |               0.004 |

|           1.579 |               0.318 |
|           1.747 |               0.418 |
|           1.908 |               0.513 |
|            2.11 |               0.636 |
|            2.23 |               0.705 |
|            2.42 |               0.816 |
|            2.58 |               0.912 |
|            2.78 |               1.031 |
|            3.06 |               1.195 |
|            3.38 |               1.384 |
|            3.78 |               1.619 |
|            4.09 |               1.803 |
|            4.43 |               2.008 |
|            4.66 |               2.145 |
|            4.81 |               2.235 |
|            4.88 |               2.275 |

I measured only up to 4.88 as I was the top I could reach with a simple potentiometer connected to a 5V rail. But this should be enough to calculate a linear regression:

Current display [A] = 0.593 * C.S voltage [V] - 0.619

The same for mappinv between the voltage on the V.S pin and the voltage diplayed:

| V.S voltage [V] | Voltage display [V] |

|           0.156 |                0.21 |

*** CON2 connector

The second unpopulated connector on the board is used for programming of the microcontroller.

I tried to read the firmware with an STLINKv2 interface but unfortunately the readout is locked.
