#+TITLE: Shrack UPS USDD-R 400

This is a short note on the discontinued Shrack [[https://www.schrack.com/shop/usdd400.html][Genio USDD-R 400]] UPS (EAN code 9004840378757). This is a tower or rackmount UPS with 4000VA of power that is
currently used as backup in my house. It operates with a DC voltage of nominal 108 V_dc which is significantly higher than 12V or 24V in consumer grade UPSes
but 10 AGM lead-cell in batteries in series does the trick here. Another nice thing that I found about this UPS (which was missing its internal batteries when I
purchased it) was the BATTERY EXTENSION connector on the back.

The BATTERY EXTENSION connector was not easy to recognize on first glance. After a while I stumbled by accident on a matching connector from WIELAND - the
[[https://octopart.com/92.954.4453.0-wieland-68095496?r=sp][GST18I5 Pole Flat Male Connector]] available from multiple distributors and with the [[file:shrack-ups-usdd-r-400/92.954.4053.1.PDF][datasheet]] mirrored.
