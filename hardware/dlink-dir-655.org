A signal trace from the J1 connector has been obtained using a Saleae Logic analyzer. The dump can be downloaded [[file:dlink-dir-655/DIR655-J1-poweron.sal][here]]. 
Attempts at decoding the signal were made using the SPI decoder have not revealed any ASCII communications - the protocol
working here looks to be binary in nature.

*** J2 connector

The trace from this connector has not yet been obtained.

** The IP7150U CPU

The UBICOM IP7150U CPU is a non-standard (that is not MIPS, ARM or any other common ISA) architecture CPU with hardware threads designed for telecommunications
equipment made by the now defunct [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubicom][Ubicom]] company now being a part of Qualcomm. There is no official alternative Linux builds for this CPU, there has been a GPL
blob released by dlink [[http://pmdap.dlink.com.tw/PMD/GetAgileFile?itemNumber=GPL1100001&fileName=DIR655B1_FW200NAb33_GPL.rar&fileSize=8.1487082E8;]] There have been
some attempts to build the firmware by James Hillard (https://github.com/jameshilliard/openwrtubicomstaging). Another source of information about this CPU is the 
now-defunct Ubicom wiki archived on the Wayback machine: https://web.archive.org/web/http://developer.ubicom.com/wiki/index.php. Unfortunately it looks like a
"Ubicom Programming Dongle" is recommended for programming and debugging the SoC. The dongle is descrived as functionally equivalent to a JTAG header therefore
it's possible that equivalent operations can be performed by any other JTAG dongle. It's not known where the official dongle can be purchased.
