It's my car. It currently hosts the [[file:../../projects/whitestar/][whitestar]] equipment. It's a 2006 Toyota Corolla with a 1.4L Diesel engine. I have been collecting fuel consumption
data for a while now and I have compiled a chart to summarize the fuel economy of the car as a variable of the average speed for each trip. This allows to
easily distinguish between in-city and highway driving.

Also there is an MPG chart more useful for US-based viewers:

In the interest of full disclosure there is also the [[file:fuel-corolla.dat][input data]] and [[file:fuel-corolla-public.gnuplot][gnuplot script]] to generate the charts.
