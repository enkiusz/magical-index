* The internals

The internals consist of only 1 PCB with all of the connectors and buttons. There is a vertically mounted 5 V power supply which has been unsoldered to make better view of the board.
The board has "AD-BT-A23 V1.0" and "2016.11.21" silkscreened on it. The PCB photos with all of the important parts highlighted:

I was unable to find any information about the particular SoC when searching for the exact mark on it. This is likely because JieLi makes a number of chip "families"
marketed towards different products and then makes a unique label on each chip based on the exact customer/product it's supposed to go. 

By looking at their site I figured that for my device the closest one should be the [[http://www.zh-jieli.com/product/68-cn.html][Jerry Bluetooth series chip AC690N/AC692N]]. 

I found some AC6921A chips on aliexpress http://aliexpress.com/i/4001141547298.html which had the same case and a pinout diagram in the auction:

As well as AC6901 chips [[http://aliexpress.com/i/10000054405573.html]] with similar pinout diagrams:

I tried to match both of these chips to what I was seeing on the board but unfortunately none of them match. The pinout that I was able to verify so far:

Some other links discovered during research:

https://github.com/christian-kramer/JieLi-AC690X-Familiarization

This is information about the AC690X Bluetooth chip from the same company. This one is different (different package) but things like flashing protocol and so on can be
similar.
